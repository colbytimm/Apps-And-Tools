# üçè macOS Apps

These are a collection of my favourite apps that I use on my macOS machines.

| Tool | Link | Description
|------|------|-------------
| Warp | https://www.warp.dev/ | Modern Terminal that allows for easier command editing, smart command completion and division of command inputs and outputs using blocks.
| Arc | https://arc.net/ | Modern browser that helps organize Spaces and Profiles and alleviate tab clutter.
| Microsoft To Do | https://to-do.office.com/tasks/ | Simple To Do app for task tracking. Helpful tool for all my fellow ADHD friends!
| Choosy | https://choosy.app/ | Allows you to open specific links in specific browsers and/or profiles.
| Spotify | https://www.spotify.com/us/download/mac/ | Why?! Because life is boring without music!
| Raycast | https://www.raycast.com/ | Application launcher (Spotlight replacement) that has a rich community of free extensions. Also love using the script feature which allows you to quickly run bash scripts.
| Magnet | https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/ | macOS has traditionally been terrible with window management and Magnet helps alleviate that frustration. Super easy to use and also has keyboard shortcuts.
| Bartender | https://www.macbartender.com/ | Helps hide and organize all your menu bar item clutter.

| ChatGPT | https://openai.com/chatgpt/mac/ | App version of ChatGPT built by OpenAI.
| AeroSpace | https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/ | Windows management for macOS that is similar to i3 on Linux. Still new to using this but will eventually add my config to this repo.
